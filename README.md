**Common Features of GTA 5 Mod Menu for PC:**

1. **Unlimited Money**:  
   One of the most popular features, allowing players to add unlimited cash to their account, making it easier to purchase properties, vehicles, and other in-game items without grinding.

2. **Vehicle Spawning**:  
   Mod menus allow players to spawn any vehicle in the game instantly, including cars, helicopters, boats, and planes. This feature enhances the game's freedom, making it easier to explore and travel.

3. **Aimbots and God Mode**:  
   Aimbots automatically aim at enemies, improving shooting accuracy, while God Mode grants invincibility, preventing players from taking damage during combat.

4. **Customizable Player Abilities**:  
   Players can modify their character’s attributes, such as health, stamina, or movement speed. Some mod menus allow for more dramatic alterations, like increasing jump height or changing character animations.

5. **Teleportation**:  
   Instantly teleport anywhere on the map, whether to specific locations or random spots. This saves time and allows for fast exploration without the need to drive or fly across the map.

6. **Environment Customization**:  
   Some mod menus let you change the environment, including weather, time of day, and other aspects of the world, adding new challenges or creating fun scenarios.

7. **Weapon and Item Modifications**:  
   Modify weapons or items, giving yourself unlimited ammo, powerful weapons, or custom gear that wouldn’t normally be available.

8. **Online Mode Mods**:  
   Some mod menus can also be used in GTA Online, offering additional features like money drops, weapon modifications, and player enhancements. However, using mods in GTA Online is risky, as it may result in account bans by Rockstar Games.

**How to Use GTA 5 Mod Menu for PC:**

1. **Download and Install**:  
   Most mod menus require downloading third-party software and placing it in your GTA 5 game directory. Ensure compatibility with your version of the game to avoid issues.
   
2. **Activate Menu**:  
   After installation, players can activate the mod menu using a specific key or combination of keys (often F8, F10, or a custom hotkey). This opens the menu, where you can select cheats and features to activate.

3. **Single-Player Mode**:  
   While mods can be used in both single-player and online modes, it’s highly recommended to use them in single-player mode to avoid penalties, as modding in GTA Online can lead to account bans.

**Ethical and Legal Considerations:**

- **Risk of Ban in GTA Online**:  
   Using mod menus in GTA Online is against Rockstar Games' terms of service. Players who use mods online are at risk of being banned from the game permanently.
   
- **Unfair Advantage**:  
   Mod menus provide players with significant advantages, disrupting the game’s balance and potentially ruining the experience for others. This is particularly an issue in multiplayer environments.

In summary, the GTA 5 mod menu for PC offers players the ability to enhance and modify their game with cheats and additional features, such as unlimited money, vehicle spawns, aimbots, and more. While these features can make gameplay more enjoyable, they should be used cautiously, especially in online modes, as modding can lead to penalties and bans. It’s always best to use mod menus in single-player mode to avoid consequences.
